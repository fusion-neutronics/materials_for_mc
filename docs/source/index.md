# Materials For MC Documentation

Materials For MC is a package for accessing nuclear cross section data

It provides tools for defining elements, nuclides, and materials then accessing cross sections and energy grids.

The package also provides functions intended for use in Monte Carlo particle transport simulations such as mean free path, sampling nuclide, sampling reaction and interpolating the cross section value at a given energy.

It provides ease of access through a Python API for users and performant access for Monte Carlo codes via a Rust API
